# P2 Slugs - Recipe Website
Welcome to our Trimester 2 Portfolio! This is where you can find and access our code and important pieces throughout the course.

### [Scrum Board](https://github.com/orgs/p2slugs/projects/1) (tracking sheet + schedule) | [Google Doc Project Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j8Poc5Uar2J0xh_4jdK0nkSDv1neLWqGaCXjXDnQRRg/edit?usp=sharing)

## Project Overview
A cooking website that has a database for recipes. We will use web scraping to find recipes.They will be organized into different categories, all using data. There will also be forms to add recipes, which we will use GET, POST, and SQLalchemy for.

## Project Components
- home page
- recipes & ingredients page
- about us page
  - describes project overview in further detail (like a README)
  - introduce team members (goals, skills, etc.)
- navigation bar will be implemented
- recipe box / cooking tips / “like” a recipe feature?
- categories of food (16 types of food total)
  - breakfast
  - lunch
  - dinner
  - dessert

## Delivery Plans & Milestones
- Fridays: asynchronous days / end of every school week
- Midterm: Jan 19-22
- N@tM: March 8-12
- College Board: May 13 (AP exam)

## Weekly Log
- Dec 8/9: tech talks and practice exam corrections; no new updates on project plan
- Dec 7: updated repo name, moved Google Doc project plan to readme, organized responsibilities on scrum board
- Dec 4: filmed video, planned goals on scrum board, and created a table of collaborators
- Dec 3: created [project plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j8Poc5Uar2J0xh_4jdK0nkSDv1neLWqGaCXjXDnQRRg/edit?usp=sharing) and wrote in new recipes for data collection, individual tasks were to find a breakfast recipe and put it on the [recipe doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14oFXFl3pcBhb3CPn6F3FZB0GHa1upJOBGRTt-Ql9KWw/edit?usp=sharing)
- Dec 2: created new organization and repo

## College Board / Teacher Requirements (Track to Meeting Them)

| Big Idea Number / Requirement           | Big Idea Summary  | Project Goal To Meet Each Requirement |
| -------------------------- |---------------------| ----------------------------------|
| Big Idea #1                | Creative Development: Collaboration, Design, Development, Function, Purpose, Resolving Errors | Working together as a team of 4 to come up with ideas and implement them. Collaboration between group and pair shares. Journals to keep track of progress. |
| Big Idea #2 and #3:        | Data, Algorithms and Programming: Using data, algorithms, and programming to create code. | Using SQLalchamey to create a database for our recipes and have the ability to add more recipes. Going beyond the Python fundamentals with logic and data. Using GET and POST, Python backend, and creating a data related UI. Having the ability to create, read, update, and delete recipes.|
| Big Idea #3:               | Algorithms and Programming: Using algos and programming to design and present to the user. | Creating a great UI desgin for our data filled website. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Making a visual storyboard before putting it into our website. We will have options to go to different recipe pages and add in your own recipes. |
| Big Idea #4:               | Computing Systems and Networks: How computing systems and networks function on the internet.| Deploying our website on a Raspberry Pi server, using HTTP protocol for communication, using GET to request data, and POST to update the data. We will use an internet router. |
| Big Idea #5:               | Impact of Computing: Realizing the effects that computing can have, possibly even with your project. | Deploying our website onto the internet with a Raspberry Pi, sharing it to the community through Night At the Museum, and sharing it with College Board (AP Test). |
