### Ingredients Page
eva: Users can now deselect the "hearty durian" ingredient, and select ingredients from the bottom section which will get highlighted in the right column. The buttons turn green when you select them, and all of this was done using Javascript functions and events. It aligns with the College Board requirements and our goals because we need to have more algorithmns, procedures, and use of lists in our project. These functions are a step towards that and I also begun working with a list of ingredients at the very bottom of the page. I'm learning how to use Jinja with lists and can get elements out of the list using indexes.

### College Board and Crossover visibility / Suggestions
Our project is aligning with the Collge Board requirements, as we are starting to implement more algorithmns, procedures, and lists into our project. We will continue to focus on these things each week. During the crossover week, we got feedback that we should focus on the CSS on some of our underdeveloped pages, spread out the workload better, organize our files with sub-folders, and add more comments to our code. These are all our focuses and futhermore for Collegeboard, our inputs/outputs with our submit page can be developed more which are ideas for the coming weeks.

## Past Completed Goals 1/11-1/15
###  1. HTML, Project Overview Page 
- __description:__ Changing the look of the website included updating the color palette, the fonts, font size, and formatting of the text. The CSS was updated to make the website more interactive and user-friendly. Although there are some pages that are not up to date, the recipes page is working well with the new format.
- __link to code:__ [base.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/base.html) and [overview.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/overview.html)
- __instructions to evaluate:__ review [here](http://99.88.196.26/) to see updates on the filtering system and overall appearance.
### 2. Sign Up Form 
- __description:__ creating a sign up form with html/css/js using a recipes theme. Changed the background color, font color and format to make the website more user-friendly. Goal for next week is to find out how to store the data input after users sign up.
- __link to code:__ [form.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/form.html), [base.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/base.html) and [views.py](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/views.py); Check Github Contributions above for specific changes.
- __instructions to evaluate:__ the website can been viewed from this link http://99.88.196.26/. Click on the sign up form tab and you will see information & profile pages where you can fill out to be our subscriber. You can check the box to rate the website, and click on the yellow bar and scroll through and select your favorite snack, so that we can genenerate users' responses and recommend you personalized meals.  
### 3. Deploy with Raspberry Pi 
- __description:__ getting the website deployed this week was a big ticket which is a card in the Scrum Board called *deploy with raspberry pi*. First, Eva had to get the site running well through Intellij, as there was a problem after transfering from repl. She edited the base.html to make room for other pages' content and allow the pages to be seen when navigated from the navabar. She edited the views.py file, made a wsgi.py file, made an init.py file, and a requirements1.txt file in prep of deployment. Following Mr. Mortensen's steps for deploying, she was able to get a virtual environment finally created but ran into more problems later on. By the running the website through her raspberry pi, she got the website up for everyone to see on her personal ip address (port forwarded).
- __link to code:__ [wsgi.py](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/wsgi.py), [init.py](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/__init__.py), [views.py](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/views.py), [base.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/base.html); Check Github Contributions above for specific changes
- __instructions to evaluate:__ the website can been viewed from this link http://99.88.196.26/ 
### 4. User Request Form Output/Storing Inputted Data 
- __description:__ after building a user input form, Ali's goal was to try and store a user's inputted name and comment on a seperate page or index by making a index template page to intake information from the input form. He was successful in getting the index page to work for the user's name, but it still working on finding a solution for the comment. This ticket is in the Scrum Board called *User Request Form Output/Storing Inputted Data*
- __link to code:__ http://99.88.196.26/ ; Check Github Contributions above for specific changes
- __instructions to evaluate:__ the website can been viewed from this link http://99.88.196.26/.  Click on the recipe request page and you will see a fill-in section. After clicking submit, a page redirect should occur where the name typed in should be stored.

## Scrum Master Grading Based on Above and Individual Support
__Individual Support__

Ali 19/20
1. tickets/cards: User Request Form Output/Storing Inputted Data; Ali would lose a point this week because the ticket didn't perfectly match up with his code. Though he was ale to store user inputted names on a seperate page through the index template, he wasn't able to store user comments on that same page, which he needs to try and fix next week. Everything else went well with Ali, regarding his code and success with the templates he worked on.
2. evidence of code: [views.py](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/views.py), [sign.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/sign.html), [index.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/index.html)
3. guidance for running and reviewing code: the website can been viewed from this link http://99.88.196.26/. Click on the recipe request page and you will see a fill-in section. After clicking submit, a page redirect should occur where the name typed in should be stored.

Linda 19/20
1. tickets/cards: I completed the sign up form, and helped a little on solving issues with deployment. I learned from Ms. Trish Ladd's lectures and her templates to create a sign up page with html/css/js with our project's theme. I changed the colors, fonts and text formats on the form so they matched the recipes theme. Together with Eva, we found out specific files that needed to be added and Eva did the deployment. Next week I need to find out how to store the data input after users sign up. 
2. evidence of code: [form.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/form.html), [base.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/base.html) and [views.py](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/views.py)
3. guidance for running and reviewing code:the website can been viewed from this link http://99.88.196.26/. Click on the sign up form tab and you will see information & profile pages where you can fill out to be our subscriber. You can check the box to rate the website, and click on the yellow bar and scroll through and select your favorite snack, so that we can genenerate users' responses and recommend you personalized meals.

Sophie 19/20
1. tickets/cards: 1) Find out how to filter recipes with tags - successful; can check progress on recipes.html or the recipes page, 2) Clean up appearance of site and make main pages look similar - definitely made the website more aesthetically pleasing on the main pages, but some other pages (such as sign up and about us) did not match the css, thus -1pt.
2. evidence of code: Check out [base.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/base.html), [recipes.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/recipes.html), and [overview.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/overview.html) for my updates on the code.
3. guidance for running and reviewing code: the website can be viewed at http://99.88.196.26/. The "recipes" page should feature a filtering system where you can select what you want to see based on meal types and dietary preferences.

Eva 18/20
1. tickets/cards: I completed the the raspberry pi big ticket item, also helped with minor changes like adding in the about us pictures. I did a lot for getting the website able to run and it worked out in the end! I had to fix our Intellij problem, make an init.py, wsgi.py file, and edit the views.py file as well. I plan to get it running solely with the new way later on. As scrum master, I also spent a lot of time on the README.md to show our code for this week.
2. evidence of code: code can be seen in links above in description of big ticket #3 as well as commits in repo. also here: [wsgi.py](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/wsgi.py), [init.py](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/__init__.py), [views.py](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/views.py), [base.html](https://github.com/p2slugs/recipebox/blob/main/templates/base.html); Check Github Contributions above for specific changes 
3. guidance for running and reviewing code: to run and review code, you can view the running website at http://99.88.196.26/ and see the files in github


__Grades From Scrum Master__
| Team Member | Grade  | Reasoning |
| ----------- | ------ | --------- |
| Eva (SM)    |   18/20   |      I focused most of my attention on getting our website to run with the raspberry pi this week. I setup our project with the following files: wsgi.py, init.py, requirements1.txt, and edited files like about.py, views.py, and imported images. I would have liked to get the website running with the new way that Mr. M provided directions for, but after getting the virtual environment to work I ran into more problems. I still fufilled my task of getting it running but plan to do it the new way in the following week(s) by going to tutorial again. For this reason, I'm taking off 2 points.        |
| Ali         |   19/20   |     Ali got the recipe request form to store user's inputs and display what they entered. There is also a link that takes you back to the main page. It was much needed in our website. I agree with his score and give him 19/20.      |
| Sophie      |   20/20   |     Sophie changed the css of the website, added the recipe cards, formatted the aboutus page better, as well as the add recipes page and overview page, and definitely put in a lot of work. It was a hard task and I think her score should be 20 instead of 19.      |
| Linda       |   19/20   |     Linda created the sign up page which is really cool, along with the design! She also put in effort to help me with the raspberry pi issues. I agree with her score!      |

## Project Overview
A cooking website that has a database for recipes. We will use web scraping to find recipes. They will be organized into different categories, all using data. There will also be forms to add recipes, which we will use GET, POST, and SQLalchemy for. Our project purpose is to create a website using more advanced techniques than Trimester 1 and present it to the community at Night At The Museum, our teacher, and College Board. We will learn how to do more with data, Python, Flask, SQLalchemy, HTML, and CSS. In addition, we will deploy our website on Raspberry Pi so people from wide area network can all access.
