# P2 Slugs - Recipe Website
Welcome to our Trimester 2 Portfolio! This is where you can find and access our code and important pieces throughout the course.

4. User Request Form Output/Storing Inputted Data
- description: after building a user input form, Ali's goal was to try and store a user's inputted name and comment on a seperate page or index by making a index template page to intake information from the input form. He was successful in getting the index page to work for the user's name, but it still working on finding a solution for the comment.

## Project Overview
A cooking website that has a database for recipes. We will use web scraping to find recipes. They will be organized into different categories, all using data. There will also be forms to add recipes, which we will use GET, POST, and SQLalchemy for. Our project purpose is to create a website using more advanced techniques than Trimester 1 and present it to the community at Night At The Museum, our teacher, and College Board. We will learn how to do more with data, Python, Flask, SQLalchemy, HTML, and CSS. In addition, we will deploy our website on Raspberry Pi so people from wide area network can all access. 

## Project Components
- home page
- recipes & ingredients page
- about us page
  - describes project overview in further detail (like a README)
  - introduce team members (goals, skills, etc.)
- navigation bar will be implemented
- recipe box / cooking tips / “like” a recipe feature?
- categories of food (16 types of food total)
  - breakfast
  - lunch
  - dinner
  - dessert
- Random Recipe Generator (API Webscraping)

## Delivery Plans & Milestones
- Fridays: asynchronous days / end of every school week
- Midterm: Jan 19-22
- N@tM: March 8-12
- College Board: May 13 (AP exam)

## Weekly Log
- Jan 6: tech talk about deployment and DevOps; 7 layers of the OSI model
- Jan 5: test prep on data and the Internet; took a quiz on the student lecture we had; missed one question about IP addresses/how the binary sysytem is related to it
- Jan 4: class discussion of 2 minute review for Thur/Fri, new year routine, and project reflections
- Dec 16: tech talks and scrum master presented an overview of project 
- Dec 14: reflected on project plan in class and started working on codes
- Dec 11: asynchronous day; each worked on individual assignment including ui mock-up, looking into CRUD, start of code, and gathering more data
- Dec 10: finalizing project plan desriptions and overviews; final updates to journals
- Dec 8/9: tech talks and practice exam corrections; no new updates on project plan
- Dec 7: updated repo name, moved Google Doc project plan to readme, organized responsibilities on scrum board
- Dec 4: filmed video, planned goals on scrum board, and created a table of collaborators
- Dec 3: created [project plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j8Poc5Uar2J0xh_4jdK0nkSDv1neLWqGaCXjXDnQRRg/edit?usp=sharing) and wrote in new recipes for data collection, individual tasks were to find a breakfast recipe and put it on the [recipe doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14oFXFl3pcBhb3CPn6F3FZB0GHa1upJOBGRTt-Ql9KWw/edit?usp=sharing)
- Dec 2: created new organization and repo

## Goals
- get website deployed
- do more with data and allow multiple ingredients and steps to be added to one recipe
- solve intellij problems with running and commit more with intellij instead of repl to track progress
- work on ui/html
- solve webscrpaing/api

## College Board / Teacher Requirements (Track to Meeting Them)

| Big Idea Number / Requirement           | Big Idea Summary  | Project Goal To Meet Each Requirement |
| -------------------------- |---------------------| ----------------------------------|
| Big Idea #1                | Creative Development: Collaboration, Design, Development, Function, Purpose, Resolving Errors | Working together as a team of 4 to come up with ideas and implement them. Collaboration between group and pair shares. Journals to keep track of progress. |
| Big Idea #2 and #3:        | Data, Algorithms and Programming: Using data, algorithms, and programming to create code. | Using SQLalchamey to create a database for our recipes and have the ability to add more recipes. Going beyond the Python fundamentals with logic and data. Using GET and POST, Python backend, and creating a data related UI. Having the ability to create, read, update, and delete recipes.|
| Big Idea #3:               | Algorithms and Programming: Using algos and programming to design and present to the user. | Creating a great UI desgin for our data filled website. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Making a visual storyboard before putting it into our website. We will have options to go to different recipe pages and add in your own recipes. |
| Big Idea #4:               | Computing Systems and Networks: How computing systems and networks function on the internet.| Deploying our website on a Raspberry Pi server, using HTTP protocol for communication, using GET to request data, and POST to update the data. We will use an internet router. |
| Big Idea #5:               | Impact of Computing: The effects that computing can have and with our project. | Deploying our website onto the internet with a Raspberry Pi, sharing it to the community through Night At the Museum, and sharing it with College Board (AP Test). |
